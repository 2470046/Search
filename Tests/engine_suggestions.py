"""Suggestions from your search engine (idea 347, EngineSuggest.swift), in a hidden probe.

Build first (`./build.sh`), then `python3 Tests/engine_suggestions.py`. The
app starts hidden in a world of its own (bld-sug-<checkout>, see
split_view.use), is driven through ./bench's socket, and is quit; its world
is removed afterwards. Nothing here makes, shows or brings forward a window.

No real engine is asked: the test world's `suggest.testURL` points the
field at a fake engine on this Mac (honoured only in a test run), and the
custom engine's searches go to the same server. It records every question,
with the headers it came with.
